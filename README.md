# ONS Alpha Wagtail site

## Technical documentation

This project contains technical documentation written in Markdown in the `/docs` folder. This covers:

- continuous integration
- deployment
- git branching
- project conventions

You can view it using `mkdocs` by running:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

The documentation will be available at: http://localhost:8001/

# Setting up a local build

This repository includes `docker-compose` configuration for running the project in local Docker containers,
and a fabfile for provisioning and managing this.

There are a number of other commands to help with development using the fabric script. To see them all, run:

```bash
fab -l
```

## Dependencies

The following are required to run the local environment. The minimum versions specified are confirmed to be working:
if you have older versions already installed they _may_ work, but are not guaranteed to do so.

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), version 19.0.0 or up
  - [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac) installer
  - [Docker Engine for Linux](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=&type=edition&offering=community&sort=updated_at&order=desc&operating_system=linux) installers
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), version 1.24.0 or up
  - [Install instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (Linux-only: Compose is already installed for Mac users as part of Docker Desktop.)
- [Fabric](https://www.fabfile.org/), version 2.4.0 or up
  - [Install instructions](https://www.fabfile.org/installing.html)
- Python, version 3.6.9 or up

Note that on Mac OS, if you have an older version of fabric installed, you may need to uninstall the old one and then install the new version with pip3:

```bash
pip uninstall fabric
pip3 install fabric
```

You can manage different python versions by setting up `pyenv`: https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/

## Running the local build for the first time

If you are using Docker Desktop, ensure the Resources:File Sharing settings allow the cloned directory to be mounted in the web container (avoiding `mounting` OCI runtime failures at the end of the build step).

Starting a local build can be done by running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/torchbox/ons-alpha
cd ons-alpha
fab build
fab migrate
fab start
```

This will start the containers in the background, but not Django. To do this, connect to the web container with `fab sh` and run `honcho start` to start both Django and the Webpack dev server in the foreground.

If you only want to run Django, run `honcho start web` (see below for further instructions on running the tooling on your host machine).

Then, connect to the running container again (`fab sh`) and:

```bash
dj createcachetable
dj createsuperuser
```

The site should be available on the host machine at: http://127.0.0.1:8000/

If you only wish to run the frontend or backend tooling, the commands `honcho` runs are in `docker/Procfile`.

Upon first starting the container, the static files may not exist, or may be out of date. To resolve this, simply run `npm run build`.

## Linting and Formatting

This project uses Ruff, pylint, and black for linting and formatting.

### Installation
To install the dependencies, run:
```sh
poetry install

Usage
To lint the code, run:
```sh
make lint
```

To format the code, run:
```sh
make format
```

To check both linting and formatting, run:
```sh
make check
```

###Â GitHub Actions Workflow
Create a workflow file named linting.yml in the .github/workflows directory with the following content:
```yaml
name: Linting and Formatting

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  lint-and-format:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.12'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
        poetry install

    - name: Run linters
      run: |
        poetry run ruff .
        poetry run pylint ons_alpha

    - name: Run formatter
      run: poetry run black --check .

  build-docker-image:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Build Docker image
      run: docker build -t ons-alpha .
```

### Frontend tooling

Here are the common commands:

```bash
# Install front-end dependencies.
npm install
# Start the Webpack build in watch mode, without live-reload.
npm run start
# Start the Webpack server build on port 3000 only with live-reload.
npm run start:reload
# Do a one-off Webpack development build.
npm run build
# Do a one-off Webpack production build.
npm run build:prod
```

There are two ways to run the frontend tooling:

- In Docker. This is the default, most portable and secure, but much slower on macOS.
- Or run npm commands from a terminal on your local machine. Create a `.env` file in the project root (see `.env.example`) with `FRONTEND=local`. `fab start` will no longer start a `frontend` container. Now, when running `fab start`, Docker won't attempt to bind to the ports needed for the frontend dev server, meaning they can be run locally. All the tooling still remains available in the container. Note that you will need to run `honcho start web` rather than `honcho start` once you have connected to the docker container (see above).

## Installing python packages

Python packages can be installed using `poetry` in the web container:

```
fab sh
poetry add wagtail-guide
```

To reset installed dependencies back to how they are in the `poetry.lock` file:

```
fab sh
poetry install --no-root
```

## Installing system packages

If you wish to install extra packages in your local environment, to aid with debugging:

```bash
fab sh-root
apt-get update
apt-get install <package>  # eg. apt-get install vim
```

Then, exit the terminal and connect again using `fab sh`.

If you run `fab build`, or the container is rebuilt for some other reason, these packages will need re-installing.

If a package is always needed (eg a Python package requires a system dependency), this should be added to the `Dockerfile`.
