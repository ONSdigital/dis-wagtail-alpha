# GDS Guide/inline index app

An app which includes page types to implements the GDS pattern: https://www.gov.uk/attendance-allowance

The parent `InlineIndex` page includes a table of contents, listing the page and its children.

InlineIndex and InlineIndexChild can be used to build a "guide" to a service or topic.
All of the pages are shown together in a flat hierarchy in the table of contents, with the index page shown as the first sibling.
The "next" and "previous" buttons navigate through the guide.
