    Restrict access to certain static files in external environment.

    Whitenoise access files in 2 ways:

    1. During development, by using finders to find files at request time. This is intercepted in `find_file`,
       and responds with a 404 for unknown files.
    2. In production, by using finders to find files at startup. This is intercepted in the constructor
       and pre-filtered for allowed files.

    Only files which start with `static_prefix` are considered, to prevent breaking `WHITENOISE_ROOT`.

    The manifest file is hidden in the external environment to prevent fingerprinting. It is not filtered.
